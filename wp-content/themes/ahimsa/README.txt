WordPress Theme: Ahren Code Ahimsa
==================================

License
-------

Thank you for downloading Ahren Code's Ahimsa WordPress theme. This theme
is released under the latest version of the GPL (currently v3), whichever
that may be at the time of your use. For the GPL, see:
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html.

You are free to use this theme for any purpose you choose, in a manner
that conforms to the GPL. I would like you to leave the  attribution at
the bottom of the theme, but you are not required to do so.

Installation
------------

Please visit the WordPress site (http://wordpress.org/) for detailed
and authoritative instructions on installing themes. For the impatient:
it is usually as simple as extracting the archive (which you seem to
have already done, since you are reading this file!) and copying the
directory ("ahimsa") into your WordPress installation directory under
wp-contents/themes.

Installing Ahimsa Skins
-----------------------

The Ahimsa scheme supports customisation of the colour (and soon font)
scheme, and such customisations can even be shared. A preliminary
version of this feature is being introduced in Ahimsa for WP 2.2 and
it will be fully fleshed out in a future release.

Notes
-----

This is by no means a "best practices", complete or feature-rich theme.
At some point, I hope it will be. In particular, you may wish to note the
below:

* The theme is intended to be bold yet pleasing. YMMV! ;-) It was built,
  like many other themes, by hacking the default. A cursory look at the
  contents will demonstrate the rather shallow understanding of the CSS
  and PHP involved. I hope to clean up most of that in future releases,
  if there is interest in this theme.

* The theme uses rounded-borders using Mozilla/Gecko and
  WebKit/KHTML/Safari specific CSS attributes. I could use the CSS3
  border-radius attribute, and I probably will, but it won't help much
  since IE does not support it anyway. Rounded borders do work with
  Google Chrome since it is based on WebKit.

* The word "ahimsa" can be taken to mean "non-violence".
